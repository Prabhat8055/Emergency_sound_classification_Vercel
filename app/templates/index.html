      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        Our Emergency Sound Classification Project is designed to identify
        critical sounds such as dog barks, gunshots, glass breaks, baby cries,
        and sirens, which often signal emergencies or potential dangers. By
        leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system processes
        audio input, classifies it into one of six predefined categories, and
        quickly determines whether the situation requires attention. Once a
        sound is detected and classified, the system ensures immediate action by
        automatically sending an alert email via Gmail to relevant individuals
        or authorities. This functionality enhances response times in
        emergencies and increases overall situational awareness, making it an
        essential tool for personal safety, security, and monitoring. This
        project highlights the seamless integration of sound detection,
        classification, and real-time notification, showcasing the potential of
        AI to create practical and life-saving applications. The system is
        particularly useful for scenarios like smart homes, public spaces, and
        industrial environments where rapid response to critical events is
        crucial.
